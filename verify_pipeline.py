"""
verify_pipeline.py: self-verify the Crypto Cronkite pipeline. Same two-layer discipline as
the Pet recall verifier (_pipeline/verify_curated.py): an offline hard gate that blocks, and
a live notify-only check that never blocks a run.

  LAYER 1  offline canary (HARD FAIL, exit 1, blocks promotion). Proves the pipeline is wired
    and fails closed, with NO network and NO API key:
     - config.json, shill_rules.json well-formed; models carry no temperature/top_p/top_k
       (those 400 on the current model family).
     - prompts exist and carry their load-bearing guardrail tokens (editor: shill/rank;
       verifier: the three verdicts + adversarial; writer: DRAFT + not financial advice +
       human take).
     - shill canary: the deterministic belt scores a known shill headline as rejected and a
       primary-source real story as clean.
     - dedupe canary: two near-identical headlines collapse into one cluster.
     - full offline replay end-to-end (aggregate->editor->verifier->writer->digest) over the
       fixture: exact cluster count, exact editor split, all three verdicts present, only
       VERIFIED+REVIEW drafted, every draft DRAFT-tagged with an empty human_take + disclaimer.
     - fail-closed canaries: a missing API key fails the LLM call closed; a REJECT/hold story
       is never published; a replay-mode approval is refused by publish.
    Any deviation -> ::error:: + exit 1.

  LAYER 2  live source check (NOTIFY-ONLY, exit 3 on content mismatch, never blocks a run).
    Fetches each configured RSS feed and asserts HTTP 200 + looks-like-a-feed. A broken feed
    -> ::error:: + exit 3 (CI marks it failed / opens an issue) but never blocks. A network
    error -> ::warning:: only.

USAGE
  python3 verify_pipeline.py canary     # Layer 1 only (exit 0 pass / 1 fail)
  python3 verify_pipeline.py sources    # Layer 2 only (exit 0 pass / 3 mismatch)
  python3 verify_pipeline.py            # both; only Layer 1 affects the exit code
